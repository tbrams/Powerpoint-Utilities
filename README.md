#Secure Powerpoint comments

This is my very first project in C# - so there might be a lot of things that could be done better... but it gets the jobs done.

I needed a way to clean up comments from powerpoint presentations before sending them to somebody. On the other hand I did not want to lose the comments, which made the default option of stripping comments a no go.

Running this program will create a copy of the selected presentation without comments. It will also backup existing comments to a standard text file for your convenience.
